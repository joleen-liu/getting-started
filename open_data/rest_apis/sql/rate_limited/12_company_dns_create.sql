-- Source: company_dns SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) hierarchy
-- reference data, in BOTH API versions side by side:
--   V3 (production)  https://company-dns.mediumroast.io/V3.0/na/sic/code/%25
--   V4 (staging)     https://company-dns-staging.mediumroast.io/V4.0/na/sic/code/%25
-- 1,005 SIC codes in each, with their full hierarchy rollup. This script is
-- the replacement for 10_company_dns_sic_create.sql (now in ../deprecated/): it
-- reuses that script's names (database COMPANY_DNS, container company_dns, raw
-- table sic_codes_raw, view sic_codes_table), so everything built on them keeps
-- working.
--
-- License: company_dns is Apache 2.0 (github.com/miha42-github/company_dns,
-- self-hostable via Docker). Its SIC data traces back to SEC's own public SIC
-- list -- query live, don't bulk-redistribute the extracted data.
--
-- Format: REST/JSON (CREATE LIGHTNING REST TABLE). The two versions differ in
-- shape as well as in field names:
--   V3  data.sics is a dynamic-key ("map-shaped") object, one key per SIC code.
--       It needs the from_json(to_json(...)) coercion to be exploded (SQL
--       companion guide, section 3).
--   V4  data is a plain array of 1,005 flat objects, so a plain explode(data)
--       is enough (SQL companion guide, section 2).
--
-- Rate limit: YES. The operator of the service sets the limits, so they differ
-- between deployments. The built-in defaults are 200 requests a minute with a
-- burst of 20 (standard), and 5 a minute with a burst of 1 (strictest). A burst
-- larger than the allowance gets HTTP 429 even when the average is low, so
-- spread requests out and cache answers on this side. A Lightning REST table
-- re-fetches on EVERY query, so the CACHE TABLE statements below are required,
-- not optional. Run this script once, deliberately; do not loop it.
--   Pacing: if you do not know the tier, assume the strictest (one request every
--   12 seconds, no bursts). Wait 15 seconds or more before each statement
--   marked "calls the endpoint" below, and run statements one at a time. One
--   visible statement can send more than one HTTP request (Zetaris can retry a
--   failing fetch on a few pooled connections), so if a statement fails with a
--   429, wait 60 seconds before retrying that one statement.
--
-- Hosts: the service is reachable at both URLs from the lab network and from
-- outside it; Zetaris fetches the endpoints itself.
--
-- Before running: this script uses the repo's user-agent placeholder. Replace
-- YOUR_APP_NAME YOUR_CONTACT_EMAIL with your own value, or run it with
-- scripts/run_sql.py, which fills it in from ZETARIS_USER_AGENT.
--
-- Status: VERIFIED (recorded 2026-10-11). Run end to end against a live Zetaris
-- instance: the V3 and V4 raw tables and all four views were created and
-- queried, and the USL models (open_data/usl/sql/01_sic_usl_create.sql and
-- 02_sic_edgar_usl_create.sql) were then created unchanged on top of it and
-- queried. The USL scripts read the V3 raw table (company_dns.sic_codes_raw),
-- not the V4 views.
-- =============================================================================
--
-- How the two versions name the same four levels:
--
--   level       V3 field             V4 field         example
--   ----------  -------------------  ---------------  ---------------------------
--   letter      division             section_id       D
--   (desc)      division_desc        section_desc     Manufacturing
--   2-digit     major_group          division_id      35
--   (desc)      major_group_desc     division_desc    Industrial And Commercial ...
--   3-digit     industry_group       group_id         357
--   (desc)      industry_group_desc  group_desc       Computer And Office Equipment
--   4-digit     sic_code             class_id         3571
--   (desc)      description          class_desc       Electronic Computers
--
-- CAUTION: `division_desc` means a DIFFERENT LEVEL in the two versions. In V3 it
-- is the letter level (Manufacturing); in V4 it is the 2-digit level. A V3-style
-- WHERE division_desc LIKE '%Manufacturing%' returns nothing on V4 data. This
-- is why the script builds four views (Step 5 onward), named for the data
-- version and the column naming:
--
--   view                          data  column names  use it for
--   ----------------------------  ----  ------------  -------------------------------
--   sic_codes_table               V3    V3            what every existing query, join
--                                                      and USL activation already uses
--   sic_codes_v4_table            V4    V4            V4 as the service now describes it
--   sic_codes_v4_compat_table     V4    V3            V4 data behind V3 column names, so
--                                                      V3-era SQL runs unchanged on V4
--   sic_codes_v3_compat_table     V3    V4            V3 data behind V4 column names, to
--                                                      compare the two like for like
--
-- Caveats:
--   1. The %25 wildcard (a literal '%') is undocumented behavior of the service:
--      the sic_code path parameter is used in a LIKE, so one '%' matches every
--      row. It returns all 1,005 codes in both versions.
--   2. SIC code 3570 is absent from both versions. That is why IBM (SIC 3570)
--      drops out of any inner join to these views, and why the SIC foreign key
--      in the sic_edgar_usl USL flags it.
--   3. USL: the USL models (open_data/usl/sql/) activate straight from the raw
--      V3 table (company_dns.sic_codes_raw), not from a view, so they are not
--      affected by the views below. Whether ACTIVATE USL TABLE can read a
--      schemastore view, and so activate from sic_codes_v4_compat_table, is
--      untested.
--   4. DESCRIBE BY only accepts letters, digits, spaces and _ . - , -- see the
--      SQL companion guide.
-- =============================================================================

-- Step 0: register the logical database. One database holds both versions' raw
-- tables. (No endpoint call.)
